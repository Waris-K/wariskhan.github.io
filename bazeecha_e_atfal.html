                        <h1><strong>An Interpretation of Ghalib's <em>Bazeecha-e-atfal</em></strong></h1>


                        <section>
                            <p>I have always desired to bring the nuggets of the best Urdu poetry, and it starts with
                                this translation.</p>
                            <p>No poem can be interpreted without thinking about what may have been happening in the
                                poet's life and the tribulations of his mind.</p>
                            <p>I have spent days studying poetry in all forms and various expressions by different poets
                                given my limited understanding of this world. I am propelled by a desire to share
                                whatever little I was able to interpret. I know that it is a huge mountain that I
                                confront, and can only share what it looks like from where I stand. I have read many
                                translations. However, each and every translation has contributed to my understanding of
                                Ghalib's beautiful poetry, and I am truly thankful to countless people who have done so.
                                Even if I can give a little more insight by trying to re-imagine the situation, I would
                                have done justice to my part, my contribution.</p>
                            <p>Apparently <em>Bazeecha-e-atfal</em> was written by Ghalib as he confronted illness and
                                was mentally preparing for death. Through the ghazal, we pass from couplet to couplet,
                                starting with Ghalib’s belittling of the world and ending with his reflections on
                                legacy.</p>
                            <p>This unique ghazal takes us from childhood to youth, through love and confusion, into
                                separation, ailments, old age, and the finality of death. It is a rare poetic document
                                that captures the stages of life in a deeply reflective manner.</p>
