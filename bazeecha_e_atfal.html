                                <h1>An Interpretation of Ghalib's <em>Bazeecha-e-atfal</em></h1>
                          
                    
                            <section>
                                <p>I have always desired to bring the nuggets of the best Urdu poetry, and it starts with this translation.</p>
                                <p>No poem can be interpreted without thinking about what may have been happening in the poet's life and the tribulations of his mind.</p>
                                <p>I have spent days studying poetry in all forms and various expressions by different poets given my limited understanding of this world. I am propelled by a desire to share whatever little I was able to interpret. I know that it is a huge mountain that I confront, and can only share what it looks like from where I stand. I have read many translations. However, each and every translation has contributed to my understanding of Ghalib's beautiful poetry, and I am truly thankful to countless people who have done so. Even if I can give a little more insight by trying to re-imagine the situation, I would have done justice to my part, my contribution.</p>
                                <p>Apparently <em>Bazeecha-e-atfal</em> was written by Ghalib as he confronted illness and was mentally preparing for death. Through the ghazal, we pass from couplet to couplet, starting with Ghalib’s belittling of the world and ending with his reflections on legacy.</p>
                                <p>This unique ghazal takes us from childhood to youth, through love and confusion, into separation, ailments, old age, and the finality of death. It is a rare poetic document that captures the stages of life in a deeply reflective manner.</p>

                                <p><em>(They put up a show before me, which looks like a child's play, where daily they have this exhibition of life from dawn to dusk.)</em></p>
                    
                                <h3>Ek khel hai aurang-e-Suleman meray nazdeek</h3>

                                <p><em>(Let's start looking at some plays that are happening around me: the kingship of the good ruler, the miracles of a messiah. I am not sure if I should care...)</em></p>

                                <p><em>(Unless I meet the creator of these, as I have my doubts about the creations. Even when I can see, how do I believe what I can't see, for example...)</em></p>
                    
                                <h3>Hota hai nihan gard mein sahra meray hote</h3>
                                <h4>Ghista hai jabeen khaak pe dariya meray aage</h4>

                                <p><em>(So when things that happen before my eyes are difficult to believe, how can I bring myself to accept what is told to me...)</em></p>
                    
                                <h3>Mat pooch ke kya haal hai mera teray peechey</h3>
                                <h4>Tu dekh ke kya rang tera meray aage</h4>
                                <p><strong>Translation:</strong> Do not look at the colors draining from me after you leave <br> Just look at the colors filling you up just by my presence</p>
                                <p><em>(So I am not even sure if you've painted me or if I have painted you in such colors that now people think you exist...)</em></p>
                    
                                <h3>Sach kahte ho khudbeen-o-khuddara hoon, na kyun hoon</h3>

                                <p><em>(You may think now that I take too much credit in the way I interpret the world, but maybe you have a narrow mind...)</em></p>
                    
                                <h3>Phir dekhiye andaaz-e-gul afshaani-e-guftaar</h3>

                                <p><em>(Look at what even I can create and weave once you offer me a good meal and charms and, of course, a blank page...)</em></p>
                    
                                <h3>Nafrat ke gumaan guzre hain, main rashk se guzra</h3>

                                <p><em>(I have been through the pangs of hatred and malice as a competing creator, so I request you not to revoke the past by mentioning the assumed creator...)</em></p>
                    
                                <h3>Imaan mujhe roke hai jo kheenche hai mujhe kufr</h3>

                                <p><em>(I feel restrained now like I have the barriers of faith looming in me...my heart sinks deeper without thought but love yet pulls stronger again..)</em></p>
