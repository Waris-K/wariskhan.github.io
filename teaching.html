							<h2><b>Teaching Statement</b></h2>
							<p> 
								As an educator, I am committed to fostering curiosity, encouraging critical thinking, and equipping students with the tools they need to solve complex, real-world problems. 
								Teaching, to me, is not just about imparting knowledge but about igniting a passion for learning and discovery in my students.
							</p>
							<p>
								My teaching philosophy is built on three core pillars: <b>conceptual clarity, real-world application, and lifelong learning</b>. I aim to simplify challenging concepts and present 
								them in ways that are accessible, engaging, and meaningful. 
								By connecting theoretical principles to practical applications, I strive to make learning relevant and impactful.
							</p>
							<p>
								My industry experience provides a unique perspective that I bring into the classroom and enables me to integrate real-world engineering challenges into my courses, 
								providing students with insights into how their learning applies to cutting-edge technologies and practical problem-solving. Whether teaching <b>Finite Element Methods, 
								Numerical Methods, Engineering Mathematics</b>, or<b> Programming for Engineers</b>, 
								I aspire to bridge the gap between theory and practice, equipping students to excel in both academic and professional domains.
							</p>
							<p>
								During my teaching and mentoring experiences, I discovered the joy of breaking down complex topics, adapting to diverse learning styles, and inspiring confidence in my students. 
								I’ve realized that the true measure of teaching success lies in helping 
								students not just understand the subject but also develop a sense of ownership and enthusiasm for their learning journey.
							</p>
							<p>
								I firmly believe that education should be a transformative and inclusive experience for all students, regardless of their background, identity, or experiences. 
								As an educator, I am committed to fostering a classroom environment that values diversity, promotes equity, and encourages mutual respect. In my teaching, 
								I aim to create an inclusive space where every student feels seen, heard, and supported. 
								I also actively seek to address biases and barriers that might hinder student participation and success, ensuring equitable access to opportunities for all.
							</p>
							<p>
								I envision to inspire students not only to excel academically but also to become thoughtful and compassionate professionals who contribute positively to a diverse and global society.
							</p>
							<p>
								Collaboration is a key skill that industry increasingly demands, and I believe it is equally vital in the classroom. Engineering solutions today are rarely developed in isolation; 
								they require teamwork across disciplines and cultures. My goal as an educator is to prepare 
								students for the collaborative nature of the modern engineering workplace, where diverse perspectives and collective problem-solving lead to the best outcomes.
							</p>
							<p>
								In my courses, I encourage collaboration through group projects, team-based assignments, and peer reviews, creating opportunities for students to work together on solving complex 
								engineering problems. For example, when teaching <b>Finite Element Methods</b>, students might work in teams to model and analyze a component under various loading conditions, 
								thereby developing both technical and interpersonal skills. Similarly, in <b>Programming for Engineers</b>, 
								students collaborate on coding projects that address real-world engineering challenges, such as optimization problems in mechanical and aerospace systems.
							</p>
							<p>
								In addition, I emphasize the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration. Engineering, particularly in fields like aerospace and mechanical design, often involves working 
								with professionals from other disciplines. By fostering teamwork in my classroom, 
								I help students develop the communication skills necessary to collaborate effectively with others, whether in academia or industry.
							</p>
							<p>
								To enhance student engagement and learning outcomes, I leverage modern pedagogical tools and methods, such as interactive coding exercises, computational modeling, and project-based learning. 
								For instance, when teaching Finite Element Methods, I integrate software such as ANSYS or Abaqus, allowing students to simulate real-world problems. In Programming for Engineers, students
								develop Python or MATLAB scripts to solve mechanical and aerospace challenges, linking coding proficiency with domain-specific applications. Similarly, in Engineering Mathematics, 
								I emphasize practical problem-solving techniques, demonstrating how mathematical principles underpin engineering innovations.
							</p>
							<p>
								Beyond technical knowledge, I aim to cultivate skills such as critical thinking, and adaptability. By designing assignments that encourage teamwork and open-ended problem-solving, 
								I hope to prepare students to navigate the evolving demands of the engineering profession.
							</p>
							<p>
								I view teaching as a dynamic and reciprocal process. While I strive to inspire my students, I am equally eager to learn from them, adapting my teaching to their needs and experiences. 
								I see teaching as an opportunity to not only share my knowledge but also to grow as an educator, mentor, and lifelong learner. Teaching is more than a career aspiration for me and 
								I approach it with enthusiasm, dedication, and a deep-seated belief in the transformative power of education to shape future engineers, innovators, and leaders.
